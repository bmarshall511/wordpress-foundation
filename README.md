# Foundation &mdash; Starter WordPress Theme

> Starter WordPress theme for developers to build incredible websites &mdash; built for performance with an average 100/100 Lighthouse score.

## Installation

1. Clone/download wordpress-foundation into the theme directory.
2. **Optional, but recommended.** Create a [child theme](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/). Using a child theme allows you to easily update Foundation when new releases are available.
2. Install [gulp-foundation](https://github.com/bmarshall511/gulp-foundation) in the theme directory. If you created a child theme, install it there.
3. Start developing.

## Development

### Development with [Elementor](https://elementor.com/)

There's pros and cons to using any page builder including Elementor &mdash; though if using a page builder, Elementor is definitely the way to go. **If you're looking to optimize to the nth-degree for performance, avoid using page builders including Elementor.**

Foundation supports Elementor & has an optional [Elementor Foundation plugin](https://github.com/bmarshall511/elementor-foundation) that provides some Foundation components as Elementor widgets. When using Foundation with Elementor, there's a few things to keep in mind:

1. Foundation variables are seperate from Elementor global settings like 'Default Colors', 'Default Fonts' and the 'Color Picker'. It's still a good idea to set the Foundation variables to match your theme as some will be used and be inherited by Elementor widgets like headline, paragraph &amp; other basic element specifications.
2. Many of the Foundation components & variables aren't needed when using the Elementor editor due to it's abiliy to configure each element like Foundation's button component.
3. You can still use any of Foundation's components in conjuction with Elementor's widgets when needed.

### Theme Development

This starter theme was developed with performance and optimization in mind. Rather than load everything, it allows developers to boost performance by loading only what the theme & individual components need. There's four ways to load Foundation components into the theme:

1. Via the normal [wp_enqueue_style](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_enqueue_style/) and [wp_enqueue_script](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_enqueue_script/) functions using the pre-registered scripts found in `inc/theme-scripts.php` and `inc/foundation-scripts.php`.
2. Via `foundation_load_library( $library )` and `foundation_load_theme_library( $library )` functions, where `$library` is one of the pre-defined Foundation/theme libraries found in `inc/theme-scripts.php` and `inc/foundation-scripts.php`.
3. Within the admin CMS, under 'Configuration' in the 'Foundation Libraries' and 'Theme Libraries' tab.
4. When using certain widgets and Elementor widgets that automatically call the library that's needed on demand.
